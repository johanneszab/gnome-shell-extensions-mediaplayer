# gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer

Changelog [as compared to github.com/JasonLG1979](https://github.com/JasonLG1979):
* Adds localizations to the actual package (.zip).
* Runs on GNOME 3.32 (Fedora 30) using the [.zip file from the release page](https://github.com/johanneszab/gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer/releases). The release on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/) contains an old code snapshot/state and hence is incompatible with GNOME 3.32.

How to install:
* extract [zip file](https://github.com/johanneszab/gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer/releases) to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions.
* enable extension.
